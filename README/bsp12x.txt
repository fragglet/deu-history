This is BSP version 1.2 dos extended, written by Colin Reed:
colin@argonaut.com

New version due to bug found by Mark Harrison that caused some
problems with flipped segs having their textures buggered up.

The GO32 dos extender has been pre-pended to the executable.

This builds a BSP node tree for your DOOM wad files.

Usage:

BSP <input file> [<output file>]

If no output file is specified 'tmp.wad' is written.

-----------------------------------------------------------

This ZIP includes the fullly commented source code for all you
Doom editor/utility writers out there.

-----------------------------------------------------------

A known problem is a conflict between the GO32 dos extender
and QEMM's DPMI... put 'set GO32=nodpmi' in your autoexec.bat
to avoid problems.
