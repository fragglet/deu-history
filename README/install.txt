               DETH v4.01 and later Installation
              ###################################

Installation:
-------------

1) Create a new directory to install DETH in

2) Copy and unzip DETH.ZIP there (no -d required)

3) Edit DOOM2.CFG and/or DOOM1.CFG and change the [wad] entry to the path for
   the DOOM2.WAD and/or DOOM.WAD on your system.

4) Make sure the VESA driver for your video card is installed or that
   you are running UniVBE or SDD or one of the universal VESA drivers.

5) Type DETH to start the editor (CWSDPMI.EXE in zip must be in
   current directory or path if DPMI manager not supplied by other
   means, like the Windows OS).


Troubleshooting
---------------

1) If it says it can't find DOOM2.WAD or DOOM.WAD, check the path to
   DOOM2.CFG, DOOM1.CFG in  DETH.INI and insure it reads:

	#Path to config files
	Doom = doom1.cfg
	Doom2 = doom2.cfg

   Also check the [wad] entry in DOOM2.CFG or DOOM1.CFG and insure it
   correctly locates your DOOM2.WAD or DOOM.WAD.

2) If the BOOM extended functions don't appear in the menus make sure
   DETH.INI has the Boom variable set to True. Running "DETH -boom" once
   should do this.

3) If the editor comes up - but most of the text is missing on the
   displays and menus, make sure DETH.FNT is in the directory you are
   running DETH from, or somewhere in the path.. 

4) Do not run DETH by double clicking DETH.EXE or a shortcut to it in
   Win'95 until you have created a shortcut, set the Program tab in
   the shortcut's properties to specify the DETH directory as the
   working directory, and set the Window properties to Full-Screen. You
   may not get fonts or load the config files properly otherwise. If you
   don't know how to edit shortcuts, start an MS-DOS prompt, make it
   full-screen with Alt-Enter, change to the DETH directory, and
   start DETH with a command line.
   
5) Write me at jflynn@pacbell.net, and explain the problem.
   I'll do my best to get you running.
