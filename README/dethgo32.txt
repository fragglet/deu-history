"Using GO32 for DETH 1.2 and What to Do If It Doesn't Work"
 by Dr Sleep

To use the GO32 environment with DETH you'll probably need to add
 the following statements (at least) to your autoexec.bat file:

  SET GO32TMP=C:\TEMP <or whatever the name of your TEMP dir is>
  SET GO32=DRIVER C:\DOOM2\DETH\DRIVERS\CIRRUS54.GRN <or your driver>

Also, if you're using a memory manager such as QEMM, you'll need to
 disable DPMI for GO32, so use:

  SET GO32=NODPMI DRIVER C:\DOOM2\DETH\DRIVERS\CIRRUS54.GRN
           ^^^^^^
 And finally, if you don't have a math coprocessor, you'll need to
 get an emulator such as EMU387, put it in a DETH\EMU directory, and
 tell GO32 where to find it, like:

  SET GO32=NODPMI EMU D:\DOOM2\DETH\EMU\EMU387 DRIVER
      D:\DOOM2\DETH\DRIVERS\CIRRUS54.GRN

DETH 1.2 is a DOS extended program (GCC) which takes advantage of
 expanded memory. If you can use DEU 5.21GCC, you can use DETH. A 
 batch file is included with DETH called runme.bat, which you may
 want to edit as per the above (or to your own tastes) and run 
 before using DETH.
