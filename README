What's this?
============

 The source to the DJGPP/GO32 port of DEU 5.2


 Now you should read the file 'COPYLEFT', which contains information
 about Copyrights and where to get things.



What do you need?
=================


   DJGPP 1.11.maint5  (gcc 2.5.7, gas 2.1.1 ...)
   LIBGRX 1.03.maint1
   patched BCC2GRX 1.2


What has been changed?
======================

    (new) means - not present in BCC/TC version...

  - almost all int's has been changed to short int (typedef:ed) [ *.C *.H ]
  - farmalloc,farrealloc... -> malloc,realloc...                [ DEU-GO32.H ]
  - a lot of implicit pointer-conversions made explicit         [ *.C *.H ]
  - removed swapping                                            [ SWAPMEM.C ]
  - fixed a (new) bug with putimage                             [ TEXTURES.C ]
  - (new) bug with bioskey removed                              [ EDIT.C, MENUS.C ]
  - new file DEU-GO32.H with some DJGPP-specific things in      [ DEU-GO32.H, DEU.H ]
  - new mouseroutines to make use of LIBGRX's mouse-handling    [ MOUSE.C ]
  - removed all unused variables                                [ *.C *.H ]
  - bug in OBJECTS.C (trying to indexing an array (SideDefs)    [ OBJECTS.C ]
     with negative index...)
  - empty strings should be represented by "", not NULL         [ DEU.C, GFX.C ]
    (works, amazingly, with BCC/TC but not with GCC)
  - made InitGfx, TranslateToDoomColor, SetDoomPalette work     [ GFX.C ]
    with LIBGRX and DJGPP
  - removed irritating (showing of) mouse-pointer when          [ LEVELS.C NODES.C ]
    building nodes
  - fixed bug when setting linedef-flags

  (I might have forgotten something, but nothing important...)


 NOTICE: You can still compile everything with BCC/TC. All GNU/TURBOC
 specific things have been moved inside #if defined(...) and such...

  - swapmem.c, memory.c removed completely

  - the stuff for the CIRRUS hardware cursor has not been included as the
    grx librarie handles all mouse functions for the GCC port. If you
    need this for a compile with BCC/TC. get the original DEU source.

  - see deu-go32.h also ...

How do I compile it?
====================

   gcc -c *.c
   gcc -o deu *.o -lm -lpc -lbcc -lgrx

   or, if you have a gnuish 'make', just type 'make' ...

 Make sure that you use the included libbcc.a, or you won't get
 outtextxy to work as it should... (explanation to this can be
 found in the doc's to LIBGRX 1.03.maint1, although it's hard to find...)


Questions?
==========

 If you have any questions or problems concerning the DJGPP/GO32 part
 of the source/program, throw me a mail...



 Remember, I only ported this, and it was fairly easy too. All the "real"
 work has been done by others, I just tweaked their work a bit.
