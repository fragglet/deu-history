			 |   INSTRUCTIONS FOR    |
			 |     NEW DEU 4.2       |
			 |  DOOM EDITOR UTILITY  |
			 *-----------------------*

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
=================

 This program is called "NEWDEU" because Brendon Wyber (the author of DEU)
 has requested that anyone who alters his DEU program calls it something
 else.  This program is based on DEU-3.01, but I originally didn't plan on
 releasing it by myself.  In fact, I sent a first version of this program
 to Brendon, hoping that he will release it soon and add new features of
 his own.

 Well, he didn't have the time to work on it, because he had to go on
 holidays.  So I eventually decided to make this program public and I choose
 the temporary name "NEWDEU".  Now that Brendon has returned, we will see if
 the next release is going to be called "DEU" or anything else...

 In short, you will probably never see any program called "NEWDEU" again.
 If Brendon starts working on my program, it will be called "DEU" from
 then on.  If he doesn't like it, I will call it something else.  Got that?

COPYRIGHT
=========

* DOOM is owned by ID software.

* The original DEU was released into Public Domain by Brendon Wyber.

* I (Rapha‰l Quinet) wrote the new user interface (mouse, menus, and so on)
  and added the different editing modes (LineDefs, SideDefs, Sectors...).

Please read the original copyright notice in "DEU.TXT".


WHAT'S NEW (4.0)?
=================

IF YOU HAVE NEVER USED DEU BEFORE, PLEASE READ "DEU.TXT" FIRST.

Here are a few things that are new to this version:

* Mouse support!  You can now use a mouse if you have one.

* The pointer may now move around the screen.  The map will scroll if the
  pointer reaches the edge of the screen.

* Better menus, 3D boxes, etc.  I changed the whole user interface.

* You can now use the first mouse button to drag an object.  If you are
  using the keyboard, press 'Ins' once when the pointer is on the object,
  move it around, then press 'Ins' once again to release it.

* More Things are now recognized (DeathMatch starts, lamps, candles,...).

* New editing modes: Vertexes, LineDefs, SideDefs, Sectors,...  Try them!

* Changes in the keyboard commands:
  - use 'Enter' instead of 'T' to edit the current or default object.
  - use 'Esc' instead of 'Q' to quit without saving changes.
  - use 'Q' instead of 'E' to save changes.
  - use 'F1' to see the help screen.
  - use 'Tab' or 'Shift-Tab' to switch from one editing mode to another

* You may now use the editor with the shareware version, but you won't
  be allowed to save your changes.  Please register your copy of the game!
  ID software did a great job; they need your money to release new games.


WHAT'S NEW IN 4.1?
==================

* You can change walls, floors and ceilings textures!  Your levels will never
  look the same again!  You may for example assign the F_SKY1 texture to the
  floor of some sectors (weird!), or make some walls transparent, etc.

* Total control over the LineDefs and Sectors attributes: you may transform
  a normal sector into a lift, trigger it from anywhere,...

* Lots of improvements in the editors.  No more "default Thing" in the
  Things editor: the 'Ins' key will now duplicate the last Thing selected.

* The keyboard arrows may be used to move the mouse pointer.  Yes, I know
  it's a silly feature.

* The 'Tab' key is now documented in the help screen.  The 'DUMP' command
  is now documented in the main DEU menu.

* The 'N' and 'P' keys may be used to jump to the Next or Previous object
  in the editor.  (You may also use '>' and '<'.)

* You still cannot create a whole new level (because you can't add new
  LineDefs, SideDefs,... - you may only change their attributes).  But you
  can do almost anything else.

WHAT'S NEW IN 4.2?
==================

* Improved selection method for Sectors and LineDefs.  Just move the pointer
  inside the Sector or on the LineDef, and it will be selected.  I don't use
  the vertices anymore.

* You can now load a patch WAD file from the main menu.  New "READ" command.
  When the last reference to a WAD file is removed from the master directory,
  this WAD file is closed.

* The parameters for the "EDIT" command are now optional.  A list of available
  levels is popped up.

* A new dialog box asks for a WAD file name after editing a level.

* New Things are recognized.  New LineDefs types.  New Sectors types.

* I had to switch to the "large" memory model, because the code is becoming
  errrr... large.


FUTURE PLANS
============

* Understand the Nodes structure.  Thanks to chrisp@halcyon.com for the
  hints about these things.  I NEED MORE HELP!  PLEASE...

* Build a correct WAD file when a Vertex has been moved.  I hopefully only
  need to rebuild the Nodes list.  But how do you do that?

* Be able to delete Vertexes (this will also delete the related objects).

* Be able to add, delete or edit LineDefs, SideDefs, Sectors, etc.
  In other words, create a true editor


WARNING
=======

The Things, LineDefs/SideDefs and Sectors editors works quite well.  You may
move Things around, insert or delete some of them, change the wall textures,
create new lifts or secret sectors, etc.  The WAD file created by NEWDEU will
always give the expected results when you play DOOM.

But the Vertex editor is far from complete: there are lots of cross-references
in the WAD files and some of them are not updated by NEWDEU.  Expect strange
results if you play with a modified WAD file: you will be able to go through
some of the walls, your screen will display strange patterns from time to
time, and so on...  The Segs and Nodes editors are under development.
Hopefully, DEU will be able to create these objects automatically, one day
or another...

If you find how to build a fully working WAD file, please tell me.
I'm still having lots of problems with the Nodes objects.  Have you got
any clues?  BTW, do you know how the Reject and Blockmap entries work?


CREDITS
=======

The credits will be in the next version of DEU.  Apologies to those who
helped me and whose names are not here...  :-)


CONTACTING THE AUTHORS
======================

* My E-mail address is: quinet@montefiore.ulg.ac.be

* Brendon's E-mail address is: b.wyber@csc.canterbury.ac.nz

I would greatly appreciate any comments and suggestions about this program.
I'll keep on watching my mailbox...  If you are working on an UNIX box, you
may use the following command to see if I have received your message :
	finger quinet@verif1.montefiore.ulg.ac.be
This will give lots of useless information to you, but you may consider it
funny.  If you have a Sun workstation with the RPlay library installed, you
will even get a silly surprise.  GNU finger is great!  Enough chattering...
Have fun with the game and the editor!
