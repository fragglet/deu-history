			 |   INSTRUCTIONS FOR    |
			 |     NEW DEU 4.0       |
			 |  DOOM EDITOR UTILITY  |
			 *-----------------------*

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
=================

 This program is called "NEWDEU" because Brendon Wyber (the author of DEU)
 has requested that anyone who alters his DEU program calls it something
 else.  This program is based on DEU-3.01, but I originally didn't plan on
 releasing it by myself.  In fact, I sent a first version of this program
 to Brendon, hoping that he will release it soon and add new features of
 his own.

 Well, he didn't have the time to work on it, because he had to go on
 holidays.  So I eventually decided to make this program public.  When
 Brendon returns, I hope that he will work on my program and release it
 under the "DEU" name.

 In short, you will probably never see any program called "NEWDEU" again.
 If Brendon starts working on my program, it will be called "DEU" from
 then on.  If he doesn't like it, I will call it something else.  Got that?

COPYRIGHT
=========

* DOOM is owned by ID software.

* The original DEU was released into Public Domain by Brendon Wyber.

* I (Rapha‰l Quinet) wrote the new user interface (mouse, menus, and so on)
  and added a basic support for editing objects types other than "things".

Please read the original copyright notice in "DEU.TXT".


WHAT'S NEW?
===========

IF YOU HAVE NEVER USED DEU BEFORE, PLEASE READ "DEU.TXT" FIRST.

Here are a few things that are new to this version:

* Mouse support!  You can now use a mouse if you have one.

* The pointer may now move around the screen.  The map will scroll if the
  pointer reaches the edge of the screen.

* Better menus, 3D boxes, etc.  I changed the whole user interface.

* You can now use the first mouse button to drag an object.  If you are
  using the keyboard, press 'Ins' once when the pointer is on the object,
  move it around, then press 'Ins' once again to release it.

* More Things are now recognized (DeathMatch starts, lamps, candles,...).

* New editing modes: Vertexes, LineDefs, SideDefs, Sectors,...  But the
  Things Editor is the only real editor for now.  The other ones are still
  under development.

* Changes in the keyboard commands:
  - use 'Enter' instead of 'T' to edit the current or default object.
  - use 'Esc' instead of 'Q' to quit without saving changes.
  - use 'Q' instead of 'E' to save changes.
  - use 'F1' to see the help screen.
  - use 'Tab' or 'Shift-Tab' to switch from one editing mode to another
    (the 'Tab' key is not documented in the help screen, because you'd
    better stay in the Things Editor).

* You can now use the editor with the shareware version, but you won't
  be able to save your changes.  Please register your copy of the game!
  ID software did a great job; they need your money to release new games.


FUTURE PLANS
============

* Ask for the PWAD file name after editing, not before starting the editor.

* Change wall, floor and ceiling textures.  This shoudn't be too difficult,
  because the SideDefs and Sectors information is already in the editor.

* Find a better way of selecting LineDefs, Sectors, etc.  For now, you can
  only select some of them.

* Understand the nodes structure.  Has someone got information about that?

* Build a correct WAD file when a Vertex has been moved.

* Be able to delete Vertexes.

* Be able to add, delete or edit LineDefs, SideDefs, Sectors, etc.
  In other words, create a true editor.


WARNING
=======

The Things editor works quite well.  You may move Things around, insert or
delete some of them, etc.  The WAD file created by NEWDEU will always give
the expected results when you play DOOM.

But the other editors (like the Vertex editor) are far from complete: there
are lots of cross-references in the WAD files and some of them are not
updated by NEWDEU.  Expect strange results if you play with a modified WAD
file: you will be able to go through some of the walls, your screen will
display strange patterns from time to time, and so on...

In short, use the other editors for exploration only!  If you find how to
build a fully working WAD file, please tell me.  I'm having lots of
problems with the Nodes objects.  Have you got any clues?


CONTACTING THE AUTHORS
======================

* Brendon's E-mail address is: b.wyber@csc.canterbury.ac.nz

* My E-mail address is: quinet@montefiore.ulg.ac.be

I would greatly appreciate any comments and suggestions about this program.
I'll keep on watching my mailbox...  If you are working on an UNIX box, you
may use the following command to see if I have received your message :
	finger quinet@verif1.montefiore.ulg.ac.be
This will give lots of useless information to you, but you may consider it
funny.  If you have a Sun workstation with the RPlay library installed, you
will even get a silly surprise.  GNU finger is great!  Enough chattering...
Have fun with the game and the editor!
