			 |   INSTRUCTIONS FOR    |
			 |     NEW DEU 4.31      |
			 |  DOOM EDITOR UTILITY  |
			 *-----------------------*

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
=================

 THE NEXT VERSION OF THIS PROGRAM WILL BE CALLED "DEU 5.0", NOT "NEWDEU"!

 The EXE file is already called "DEU.EXE".  In the next release, the ZIP
 file will also loose its "NEW" prefix.  Take note!

 I used the name "NEWDEU" because Brendon Wyber (the author of the original
 DEU editor) had requested that anyone who alters his DEU program calls it
 something else.  But I will give the program back to Brendon after the next
 major revision.  From then on, you will only see "DEU", not "NEWDEU".

 This file will be removed in the next version.  All documentation will be
 in DEU.TXT and MANUAL.DOC.


COPYRIGHT
=========

* DOOM is owned by ID software.  Thanks to ID for making such great games!

* The original DEU was released into Public Domain by Brendon Wyber.

* I (Rapha‰l Quinet) wrote the new user interface (mouse, menus, and so on)
  and added the different editing modes (LineDefs, SideDefs, Sectors...).
  Even if I rewrote nearly 80% of the code, this editor still has its strong
  DEU roots... :-)

Please read the original copyright notice in "DEU.TXT".  This is the text
file that came with DEU 3.01 (the lastest DEU release before I started working
on my version).


WHAT'S NEW (4.0)?
=================

IF YOU HAVE NEVER USED DEU BEFORE, PLEASE READ "DEU.TXT" FIRST.

Here are a few things that are new to this version:

* Mouse support!  You can now use a mouse if you have one.

* The pointer may now move around the screen.  The map will scroll if the
  pointer reaches the edge of the screen.

* Better menus, 3D boxes, etc.  I changed the whole user interface.

X You can now use the first mouse button to drag an object.  If you are
  using the keyboard, press 'Ins' once when the pointer is on the object,
  move it around, then press 'Ins' once again to release it.

* More Things are now recognized (DeathMatch starts, lamps, candles,...).

* New editing modes: Vertexes, LineDefs, SideDefs, Sectors,...  Try them!

* Changes in the keyboard commands:
  - use 'Enter' instead of 'T' to edit the current or default object.
  - use 'Esc' instead of 'Q' to quit without saving changes.
  - use 'Q' instead of 'E' to save changes.
  - use 'F1' to see the help screen.
  - use 'Tab' or 'Shift-Tab' to switch from one editing mode to another

* You may now use the editor with the shareware version, but you won't
  be allowed to save your changes.  Please register your copy of the game!
  ID software did a great job; they need your money to release new games.


WHAT'S NEW IN 4.1?
==================

* You can change walls, floors and ceilings textures!  Your levels will never
  look the same again!  You may for example assign the F_SKY1 texture to the
  floor of some sectors (weird!), or make some walls transparent, etc.

* Total control over the LineDefs and Sectors attributes: you may transform
  a normal sector into a lift, trigger it from anywhere,...

* Lots of improvements in the editors.  No more "default Thing" in the
  Things editor: the 'Ins' key will now duplicate the last Thing selected.

* The keyboard arrows may be used to move the mouse pointer.  Yes, I know
  it's a silly feature.

* The 'Tab' key is now documented in the help screen.  The 'DUMP' command
  is now documented in the main DEU menu.

* The 'N' and 'P' keys may be used to jump to the Next or Previous object
  in the editor.  (You may also use '>' and '<'.)

X You still cannot create a whole new level (because you can't add new
  LineDefs, SideDefs,... - you may only change their attributes).  But you
  can do almost anything else.


WHAT'S NEW IN 4.2?
==================

* Improved selection method for Sectors and LineDefs.  Just move the pointer
  inside the Sector or on the LineDef, and it will be selected.  I don't use
  the vertices anymore.

* You can now load a patch WAD file from the main menu.  New "READ" command.
  When the last reference to a WAD file is removed from the master directory,
  this WAD file is closed.

* The parameters for the "EDIT" command are now optional.  A list of available
  levels is popped up.

* A new dialog box asks for a WAD file name after editing a level.

* New Things are recognized.  New LineDefs types.  New Sectors types.

* I had to switch to the "large" memory model, because the code is becoming
  errrr... large.


WHAT'S NEW IN 4.31?
===================

* New mouse interface: the left button is used to mark/unmark objects, the
  right button is used to drag an object or a group of objects, and the middle
  button is used to edit an object or a group of objects.  The object detection
  algorithm has been slightly improved.

* You may mark on unmark any object and edit or move all marked objects in
  only one operation.

* Command line parameters: "-sb" or "-swapbuttons" swaps the left and middle
  buttons of the mouse.  "-d" or "-debug" lets you see the Segs and Nodes in
  the editor.  "-q" or "-quiet" makes less noise.  "-e" or "-expert" doesn't
  ask for confirmation when you delete one object.

* You may now add or delete ANY object (Things, Vertices, LineDefs, SideDefs
  or Sectors).  One more step towards the Holy Grail (the absolute editor)!

* Most LineDefs types are now recognized.  You can easily create a lift, a
  moving floor, a teleporter, a crushing ceiling, etc.  Different colors are
  used for the special LineDefs or Sectors.  They will be easily distinguished
  from the normal ones.

* New "snap to grid" option.  New "zoom on pointer" feature.

* New keyboard shortcuts: use "T", "V", "L", "S" to switch to the Things,
  Vertexes (vertices, I know!), LineDefs or Sectors editor.

* Many bug fixes.  The bug in the BlockMap builder has been fixed.  The bug in
  the "-debug" (!) option has been fixed.

* A manual file, "MANUAL.DOC".  Read this if you want to know how to use DEU.


FUTURE PLANS
============

* Create an automatic Nodes builder.  Thanks to chrisp@halcyon.com for the
  hints about these obscure things.  I will hopefully soon be able to create
  a full-featured editor (the first one?).

* Display the walls/floors/ceilings textures in 256 colors.

* Display the Things in 256 colors, when you select them.  Use the extended
  VGA modes for all editors, instead of the standard 16 color mode.

* Add scrollbars to some dialog boxes.

* Add XMS support.


A WORD OF WARNING...
====================

If you move any Vertex or add new LineDefs, SideDefs or Sectors, you will
certainly get the "hall of mirrors syndrome" at some place in the game, just
like when you use the "no clipping" cheat mode and go through a wall.  This
is because the editor doesn't update the Nodes objects that are needed for
rendering.  The next version of this program will be called "DEU" and will
include a Nodes builder.


CREDITS
=======

* Guess what?  Thanks to ID for making such great games!

* Thanks to Matt Fell (matt.burnett@acebbs.com) for his great Unofficial Doom
  Specs.  I found lots of useful informations in this file.  As I'm not very
  good at writing docs, you should take this file as a technical reference and
  companion manual for DEU.  Get the file "dmspec12.txt" by anonymous FTP on
  "wuarchive.wustl.edu" (/incoming/msdos_uploads/games/doomstuff).

* Thanks to Chris Phillips (chrisp@halcyon.com) for his help about the NODES
  object.  If DEU is sooner or later able to create a new level from scratch,
  I will owe him a lot.

* Thanks to Trevor Phillips (rphillip@cc.curtin.edu.au) and Brian Downing
  (bdowning@ncsa.uiuc.edu) for their numerous suggestions and bug reports.

* Thanks to Will Ellett (wellet@cs.uah.edu), Barry Bloom (barry@noc.unt.edu),
  E. Boling (edb9140@tamsun.tamu.edu), X? (stu_gwgrimsb@vax1.acs.jmu.edu) and
  many others for their suggestions, bug reports and comments about NewDEU.


FREE ADVERTISEMENT
==================

If you are using UNIX (Linux is a good example), you should have the two
following programs.  They were not written by me, but I really like them:

* Rplay is used to play sounds on a local or remote host.  It is available
  on "sounds.sdsu.edu" (/pub/rplay/...) and "bear.montefiore.ulg.ac.be".
  Rplay3.2 will hopefully be available within a few weeks and include support
  for various sound formats (.au, .wav, .aiff, 8/16 bits, mono/stereo).

* CrossFire is a multi-player graphical adventure game for X Window.  It takes
  its inspiration from other games like nethack, moria, gauntlet, etc.  The
  graphics are not as pretty as Doom, but this is not the point.  You can get
  it from "ftp.ifi.uio.no" (/pub/crossfire/...) and "ftp.world.net".


CONTACTING THE AUTHORS
======================

* My E-mail address is: quinet@montefiore.ulg.ac.be

* Brendon's E-mail address is: b.wyber@csc.canterbury.ac.nz

I would greatly appreciate any comments and suggestions about this program.
I'll keep on watching my mailbox...  If you are working on an UNIX box, you
may use the following command to see if I have received your message:
	finger quinet@verif1.montefiore.ulg.ac.be
This will give lots of useless information to you, but you may consider it
funny.  If you have a Sun workstation with the RPlay library installed, you
will even get a silly surprise.  GNU finger is great!  Enough chattering...
Have fun with the game and the editor!
