2.00       26 Jan 93    First release. Had two programs DDIR and DEDT and
                        used text THING DATA files.

3.00       29 Jan 93    Second Release. Merged DDIR and DEDT into one 
                        program. Replaced THING DATA files with PWAD files.
                        Released with source code.

3.01       29 Jan 93    Bug fix, can now edit levels higher than 3.



WAD Files
==========

The DEU works by editing the database that DOOM uses to store its information
about each of the levels. These database files are called WAD file. There are
two types of WAD files.

IWAD File:  This is the main data base file. It contains all the information
            about the graphics, sound, level maps, etc of the game. There is
            only one IWAD file. That is called DOOM.WAD and it must be in the
            current directory when DOOM is run.

PWAD File:  This is a specail patch of the IWAD file. It contains updates
            about the IWAD file. PWAD files created by DEU will contain an
            updated map of a game level. PWAD files can be called anything.
            When running DOOM, DOOM must be told to load a PWAD file. This
            us done with the -FILE parameter. E.g.:
                 
                 DOOM -FILE E1M1.WAD
            
            will load the normal doom game and the use the E1M1.WAD file to
            patch the data base. Note: More than one PWAD file can be 
            loaded. E.g.:
                
                DOOM -FILE E1M1.WAD BOB.WAD TOM.DM
            
            PWAD files are small so they can be easily shared.



RUNNING DEU
============

To run DEU just type in 

   DEU <Doom's Main Wad File>   [<patchwad file list>]

Where the first arguement is the name of the main DOOM wad file. Following
that is a list (seperated by spaces) of any PWAD files created before.

You should then be presented with the prompt. The following commands are
available. Note the first word of each command can be appreviated to
its first letter.

?
   This command displays a list of the available command with their
   valid command syntax.

BUILD <OutIWadFileName>
   This will make a completely new IWAD main file (all 10Megs of it) with
   the given file name. Not really neccesary now. Note this includes all
   the differences from the PWAD files. In order for DOOM to run using this
   file it must be called DOOM.WAD and be in the DOOM directory.

EDIT <game> <level> <OutPWadFileName>
   This command will call up the Thing editor for the given map, allowing 
   the user to edit it. There resulting level will then be saved into
   a PWAD file of the given name. The created PWAD file will then be added 
   to the list of PWAD files already opened. (See below).

LIST <OpenedWadFileName> [OptionalOutputFile]
   This command will list the structure of the directory of a opened file.
   More for interests (and debugging) sake. If an output file is given it
   will then write the list to that file instead.

MASTER [OptionalOutputFile]
   This will list the Master directory of the IWAD and any PWAD files, all
   mixed together. More for interests (and debugging) sake. If an output file 
   is given it will then write the list to that file instead.

QUIT
   This quits the program.

WADS
   This will list all the opened wad files at the moment. They are ordered
   in order of old to newest, where the newer patch WAD files may overwrite
   the previous ones.



RUNNING THE THING EDITOR
=========================

The Editor will only edit the objects in the Map NOT the actual Map itself.
The editor will let you insert, delete and edit things in there. 

When the editor starts up it should display the Map. In the centre of the
map is a cross hair with marks your current position. Little x's represent
the things. Red one are enemies, green ones are player start poistions, and
the rest are white. There are also three onther areas.

Title Bar: If this changes colour you are being prompted for a question.

LowerLeft: This displayed the available options.

Lower Right: This displays data on the slecting thing if the cross hairs
             is on one. Otherwise it displays the default object.

The following keys are available:

Cursor keys:    To move around the map.

Space Bar:      To toggle the movement between three speeds: slow, med, fast.

MINUS and PLUS: To zoom in and out of the Map.

E:              To exit the editor.

Q:              To quit the editor, forgetting any changes.
                Will prompt you for a Y.

T:              Edits either the current object or the default object.
                Will lead you through a large menu system.

Delete:         Deletes the current object if there is one.

Insert:         Inserts an object the same as the default object.
