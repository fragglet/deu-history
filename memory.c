/*
   Note from RQ:
      To prevent memory fragmentation on large blocks (greater than 1K),
      the size of all blocks is rounded up to 8K.  Thus, "realloc" will
      move the block if and only if it has grown or shrunk enough to
      cross a 8K boundary.
      I don't do that for smaller blocks (smaller than 1K), because this
      would waste too much space if these blocks were rounded up to 8K.
      There are lots of "malloc"'s for very small strings (9 characters)
      or filenames, etc.
      Thanks to Craig Smith (bcs@cs.tamu.edu) for some of his ideas
      about memory fragmentation.
